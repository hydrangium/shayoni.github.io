            <p id="aboutme">Hello! I'm Shayoni Mahato, a passionate college student pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Durgapur. With a thirst for knowledge and a curiosity about the world around me, I'm on a journey to expand my horizons and develop valuable skills. My area of interest is software development and my college provided immense opportunities to work in this area. When I'm not buried in textbooks, I enjoy doing graphic designing. These activities have not only enriched my college experience but also helped me in my holistic development. As I progress through my academic journey, I'm excited to dive into the world of coding, all while cherishing the connections I make along the way. Feel free to join me on this adventure and explore the world of software development. Let's connect!</p>

            <h2>MY PROJECT</h2>
            <p id="about_project">My project involves the detection of corona discharge in extremely high voltage transmission lines. My approach to achieving this goal is by using a Lucid Vision UV Camera to capture images of transmission lines where corona discharge is taking place.Then by using image processing and deep learning we tried to detect the exact location of corona discharge in the transmission lines. Here is the complete description of my work: <a href="project.pdf" target="_blank">Download Project</a></p>

            <h2>MY INTERESTS</h2>
            <p id="myinterest">Graphic designing is a realm that has always fascinated me. The ability to convey complex ideas and emotions through visuals is a unique and powerful form of communication. My journey into graphic designing began during my first year in college, where I found myself experimenting with design software and discovering the joy of creating eye-catching visuals. What started as a hobby soon turned into a passion as I delved deeper into the intricacies of typography, color theory, and layout design. I've undertaken various projects like designing posters for college events as I was a part of the graphic design team of Students' Alumni Interaction Cell,NIT Durgapur. Each project has been a learning experience, helping me understand the balance between creativity and practicality. As I continue to grow as a designer, I look forward to exploring new design trends and contributing my visual perspective to meaningful projects.Here are few of my designs: <a href="My_Designs.pdf" target="_blank">Download My_Designs</a></p>
